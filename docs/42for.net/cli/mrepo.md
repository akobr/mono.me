## Get information

TODO: add a gif

You can use the tool to get information about which Nuget packages are used and which versions. Where the project is referenced, even outside the repository as Nuget package. Get the exact dependecy tree, get a list of all projects, and much more.

## Build any subtree

By just calling a single command from any place of the repository. The MsBuild will be triggered and always build the coresponding subtree.



## Prepare release + notes

TODO: add a gif

A posibility to fully automate releases and release notes, just with help of git history and clean commits.

## Create new content

TODO: add a gif

The creation of the new content is simple and it will help with set up of the correct structure.
