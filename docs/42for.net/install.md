# Install

Here is the shortest way to get your hands dirty and use the tools.

## The .net mono repository

To start with the mono-repo CLI interface, you need to have the dotnet CLI installed and then run a single command:

``` powershell
dotnet tool install 42.Monorepo.Cli --global --prerelease
```

After that, you can use your favorite IDE, Git tools and start building your first .net-friendly mono repository; please continue with [the documentation](https://github.com/akobr/mono.me/blob/main/docs/Monorepo/README.md).

## The 2S platform

::: warning

The platform is under development, and access will be revealed soon.

:::

The simplest way is to create an account and build your annotation-based and subscription-based platform today. To integrate it with your application, use our .net SDK.
