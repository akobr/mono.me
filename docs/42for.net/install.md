# Install

Here is the shortest way how to get your hands dirty and start using the served tools.

## The .net mono repository

To start with the mono-repo CLI interface you need to have dotnet CLI interface installed and then run a single command:

``` powershell
dotnet tool install 42.Monorepo.Cli --global --prerelease --ignore-failed-sources
```

After that you can use your favourite IDE, git tools, and start building your first .net friendly mono repository, please continue with [the documentation](https://github.com/akobr/mono.me/blob/main/docs/Monorepo/README.md).

## The 2S platform

::: warning

:::

The simplest way is to create an account and start building your annotation-based and subscription-based platform. To integrate it with your application use our .net SDK.
