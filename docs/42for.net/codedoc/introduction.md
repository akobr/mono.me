# Introduction to codedoc (codɵboↄ) <Badge type="danger" text="10% done" />

**Codedoc** transforms your .NET project into a **self-contained, AI-ready documentation and knowledge package**.

Think of it as a NuGet-like metadata companion for your codebase: it stores structured code intelligence, technical documentation, diagrams, and insights about your system's health.

It merges the simplicity of a **single distributable package** with the transparency of a Git repository - making differences, evolution, and history easy to understand.

Once a codedoc package is generated for a specific version of your codebase, you can share it as:

- a **Git repository**, or
- a **single packaged file**

Any editor that supports Markdown and Mermaid diagrams can browse it manually, but the full power comes from custom tooling:

- full-text search
- code-aware lenses
- context-sensitive commands
- diagram views that match your current file and cursor position
- multi-level architecture zooming
- interactive dependency graphs

This creates a deeply integrated documentation experience inside your IDE.
