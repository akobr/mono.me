# Toolkit for CLI application

> The text-base UI is the best user interface ever made❣️

This library combines multiple .net libraries into one package to simplify the creation of a CLI application. The result is easy to use because it has a nice interface, is IoC-friendly, and uses the `IHostBuilder` principle. 

Getting Started Guide is available in [the package readme file](package-readme.md).

## Adapted CLI libraries

- [Alba.CsConsoleFormat-NoXaml](https://github.com/Athari/CsConsoleFormat) - adds a possibility to draw complex and structured content
- [Colorful.Console](https://github.com/tomakita/Colorful.Console) - makes the console colorful
